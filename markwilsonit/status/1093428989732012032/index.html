<p>I didn&rsquo;t know you were a cyclist too. I&rsquo;ve done it twice now (but it was cut short the first time due to weather). TBH I think it&rsquo;s a bit too busy (and dangerous in places with mix of rider abilities) but feel sorry for those who want to do it and can&rsquo;t get in. Repeatedly!</p>
